# Token Price Oracle Example

This example demonstrates how to retrieve the price of a token, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, from an off-chain function and store it in a smart contract. This process involves fetching real-time token prices from an external source and updating the smart contract with the latest data.

## Overview
**1. Smart Contract**: A smart contract that holds the price of a specific token.

**2. Off-chain Function**: A function that fetches the real-time price of the token from an external API or data source.

**3. Integration**: The smart contract makes an off-chain call to the function, retrieves the token price, and updates its state.
